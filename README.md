A lightweight, open-source Windows taskbar widget for monitoring Claude Code usage limits and reset times. It can also display usage for Codex, Google Antigravity, OpenCode Go, and Cursor.

## Features

- Displays current usage and time remaining until each limit resets
- Counts usage up from zero or down from the full allowance, whichever you prefer
- Flags whether Claude usage is running ahead of or behind a flat pace, with the projected total for the window
- Supports Claude Code, Codex, Google Antigravity, OpenCode Go, and Cursor
- Lives in the Windows taskbar with quick controls in the system tray
- Supports multiple monitors and Windows startup
- Includes configurable refresh intervals, providers, languages, and updates
- Provides built-in themes and a visual Theme Studio for custom layouts
- Collects no analytics or telemetry

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- At least one supported provider installed and signed in

Claude Code credentials can be detected from the CLI, Claude desktop app, or WSL. Other providers are optional and can be enabled independently from the dashboard.

## Installation

Install the latest release with WinGet:

```powershell
winget install CodeZeno.ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor
```

Alternatively, download `claude-code-usage-monitor.exe` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/releases).

## Usage

Start the monitor:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor
```

Open the settings dashboard directly:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor --dashboard
```

Use the dashboard to select providers, change the refresh interval, choose a display, enable startup, or customize the widget. **Settings > Display > Usage direction** switches the default theme and other themes that support this setting between showing what has been used and what is left, with Used as the default. Selecting Remaining makes a fresh limit read 100% and drain as you work.

Each Claude row in the default theme carries a pace badge to the right of its figures. The arrow reads `↑` when usage is at least 10% ahead of a flat pace through the window, `↓` when it is at least 10% behind, and `=` while it is on pace. The number beside the arrow is the total the window would reach if the current average pace held to the reset, so `↑112%` means the limit arrives before the window does. The badge stays hidden until a tenth of the window has passed, and whenever the reading was carried over from a failed poll.

Theme authors can opt in with `.display` bindings, including `{claude.session.display:usage_line}` and `{claude.session.display:usage_badge}`. Existing `.percentage`, `.remaining`, and unsuffixed usage summaries keep their meaning; warning thresholds should continue to use `.percentage`.

In the default theme, left-click a provider tray icon to show or hide the widget and right-click it to open the menu.

## Provider setup

| Provider | Setup |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Sign in with the Claude Code CLI or desktop app. Windows and WSL credentials are detected automatically. |
| Codex | Install and sign in to the Codex CLI, then enable Codex in **Providers**. |
| Google Antigravity | Sign in to Antigravity, then enable it in **Providers**. |
| OpenCode Go | Connect an OpenCode Go account, configure the credentials described below, then enable OpenCode in **Providers**. |
| Cursor | Sign in to Cursor, then enable it in **Providers**. The local session is detected automatically. |

For OpenCode Go, set `OPENCODE_GO_WORKSPACE_ID` and `OPENCODE_GO_AUTH_COOKIE`, or create `%APPDATA%\opencode-go\config.json`:

```json
{
  "workspaceId": "wrk_01...",
  "authCookie": "your-opencode-auth-cookie"
}
```

The workspace ID is part of the OpenCode Go workspace URL. The auth cookie comes from an authenticated `opencode.ai` browser session. Set `OPENCODE_GO_CONFIG_FILE` to use a different config path.

For Cursor, `CURSOR_SESSION_TOKEN` can override the automatically detected local session.

## Data and privacy

The monitor reads local sign-in credentials for enabled providers and sends usage requests directly to their official services. It has no backend service, collects no telemetry, and does not upload credentials or project files.

Credentials are read without modifying the provider files that contain them. OpenCode Go credentials saved in a JSON configuration file are plain text and should be protected like a browser session cookie.

## Troubleshooting

Run diagnostics with:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor --diagnose
```

The diagnostic log is written to `%TEMP%\claude-code-usage-monitor.log`. Application settings are stored in `%APPDATA%\ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor\settings.json`.

## Build from source

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 1.95 or later, then run:

```powershell
cargo build --release
```

The executable will be created at `target\release\claude-code-usage-monitor.exe`.
